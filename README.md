# Event-Security-System

Digital centralized ticket system which
aims to revolutionize the way entry tickets
for events are distributed and checked.
System uses PostgreSQL and RFID checker
which is programmed for Arduino UNO.
I was responsible for transport
information from people who are registered
from the app that we created via Django
to database server that we created 
with using PostgreSQL.
